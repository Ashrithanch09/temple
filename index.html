        Great Masters are always with us. At one time, there lived two great
        Masters as husband and wife, Atri and Anasuya. Atri was the saint, and
        Anasuya, his wife. In the Indian tradition, very powerful women attained
        their power by just serving the husbands, and Anasuya was one of them.
        She reached her spiritual power by serving her husband while he
        concentrated on his austerities. The following mythological story speaks
        about the spiritual power of Anasuya. Once Narada Rishi took a small
        ball of iron—the size of a gram-grain—to Sarasvati and said to her, ‘O
        Sarasvati Devi! Please fry this iron ball. I will eat this
        iron-ball-gram during my travels’. Sarasvati laughed and said, ‘O Rishi
        Narada! How can this iron ball be fried? How can this be eaten?’ Narada
        afterward went to Mahalakshmi and Parvati and requested them to fry the
        iron ball. They also laughed at Narada Rishi. Then Narada said, ‘O
        Devis! See, I will get it fried by Anasuya, wife of Atri Maharishi, a
        great Pativrata who lives in the earth-plane’. Then Narada came to
        Anasuya and requested her to fry the iron-ball-gram. Anasuya put the
        iron ball in the frying pan, meditated on the form of her husband, and
        put a few drops of water, which had been used in washing the feet of her
        husband on the iron ball. The iron ball was at once fried. Narada went
        to Sarasvati, Lakshmi and Parvati, ate before them the fried
        iron-ball-gram, and gave them also a little of it. He greatly praised
        the glory of Anasuya and her chastity. Her power and purity were such
        that the three goddesses became jealous of Anasuya’s great strength and
        wanted to test her. So they approached the trinity, Brahma, Vishnu, and
        Shiva, and asked them to come to Earth and test this lady. They came as
        three wandering monks. In the Hindu tradition, if anybody comes to your
        house a guest or visitor, they must be given food. It is not a good idea
        to serve them with nothing. While Atri had gone to the river to have a
        bath, Anasuya was at home alone. The three Gods thus arrived at the
        house as wandering monks asking for food. They asked her, ‘We are
        hungry. Can you serve us some food?’ She had not prepared any food in
        the house at that time, so she said, ‘Please wait; let me make something
        and give you.’ They answered, ‘Yes, but we have one condition: you
        should serve us the food naked without any clothes.‘
